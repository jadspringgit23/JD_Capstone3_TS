# Analyzing Model Performance in Online Sales from India: A Case Study on Amazon's 2022 Sales Report
This paper focuses on identifying the most effective modeling techniques for analyzing e-commerce data. We initially compared four models—Multiple Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree—to determine which would best fit the dataset. Details about the variables used in these models are outlined in the capstone two ((https://github.com/jadspringgit23/FinalProject_Report.git). Since the results did not provide conclusive evidence favoring one model over the others, there is potential for improvement in future analyses of similar datasets. Given that the data is time-stamped, time series analysis will be employed to explore how the selected variables are correlated over time. Consequently, this study will utilize the ARIMA model to analyze the variable "Sales," derived from "Qty" and "Amount," with respect to the date. Such a variable that was exclude while conducting the test for the previous four models.

# Data Preparation for the Time Series Analysis
This study focuses exclusively on data manipulation techniques relevant to time series analysis. The data manipulation methods from capstone two are not covered here, as they are detailed in that earlier work. To reiterate, this time series analysis uses the same dataset as capstone two, with the addition of the "Date" variable, which has been converted to the "datetime" format, and the newly created "Sales" variable, derived from "Qty" and "Amount.
